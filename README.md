It leverages various machine learning models and algorithms to detect abnormality in the sensor data.


## Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
- [Insurance Prediction](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/regression_Insurance_prediction.ipynb)</b>: Regression model Using TensorFlow to predict the cost of insurance for individuals. 
- [FashionMnist](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/classification_fashion_mnist.ipynb) : Multi class Classification on the fashion mnist dataset In TensorFlow having 10 classes of fashion accessories.
  
- [Pizza/Steak](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/CNN_Pizza_Steak.ipynb) : To classify Images of Pizza and Steak using Covolutional Neural Networks.
  
- [Food101](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/CNN_Transfer_learning_food101_project.ipynb) : 
	- Deep Learning model for Image Classification of 101 classes of food using TensorFlow.
	- Leverage the EffientnetBX architecture using transfer learning techniques.
	- The model was fine tuned and the validation accuracy was found to be 80.16% which beats the deep food paper 2016.

- [DTweets](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/DTweets_NLP.ipynb) : 
	- To classify tweets indicating a disaster or not indicating a disaster (binary classification) using Natural Language processing.
	- The text data was vectorized using TF-IDF.
	-  Different modelling Experiments such as were carried out such as Naïve Bayes Model, feed forward NN model, LSTM model, GRU model ,Bidirectional LSTM model , 1D CNN , TF Hub universal 	sentence encoder(USE)
	- The USE model, LSTM and Naïve Bayes were the best performing models.
	- Creating an Ensemble model by averaging the combined probability predictions of Naïve Bayes, LSTM model and USE model
   
-  [SkimLit](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/SkimLit_NLP.ipynb) :
	- Sequential Sentence classification in Medical Extracts(Replicating the deep learning model behind PubMed 200K RCT).
	- This model classifies the abstract of a medical paper into Background, Methods, Results, Conclusions.
	-  A hybrid embedding layer was created – combining pretrained token embeddings + character embeddings.
	- The final model is a tribid model which combines token embeddings, character embeddings and positional embeddings with accuracy = 82.74, precision = 0.826, recall = 0.825 and f1= 0.827
	
- [BitPredict](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/BitPredict_Timeseries_and_Forecasting.ipynb): 
	- Predicting the future price of Bitcoin using Timeseries and Forecasting Technique and TensorFlow.
	-  Different  forecasting concepts like windowing and horizons were applied.
	-  Different modelling experiments were carried out like Naïve Bayes model, Dense model, Conv1D model, LSTM model, Dense Multi Variate model, N-BEATs algorithm.
	- The Dense model was seen to be the best performing model among all the experiments carried out. The the price of bitcoin was hence forecasted using the Dense model trained on the full data.

## Android App
-  [InvestoReady (DBMS PROJECT)](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/InvestoReady)</b>: An Android application that will display top 15 stocks (Selected by a stock market expert) and their analyzed data (P/B Ratio , P/E Ratio , Return on Equity , Dividend Yield , Debt to Equity and Net Profit Margin and Stock Prices from year 2006 to 2022). This application is mainly for beginners. The application also provides the user to automatically generate a portfolio for stocks and also provides a Return of Investment Calculator (ROI) for 2 stocks (as of 08/12/2022) namely TCS and Infosys

  
## Web Applications

Basic Projects using html, css, JavaScript, php, Mysql

- [CRUD iNotes](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Web%20Dev/CRUD) : Basic Website which allows one to store notes into the database. Functionalities include: insert, delete, edit a note from the Mysql Database.
- [Credit](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Web%20Dev/credit) : This is a Creditors website for a business. It basically keeps the details of all the creditors(those who buy and pay the money later).
 One can add a new creditor, delete an existing and get the sum of amount he is left to pay. All the details of the creditors are stored in the database .<br>
 
 ## Games
  Initially to start with python, I tried to make some games out of curiousity

- [Space Invadors Retro](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Games/Space%20Invadors) : This is a 2D game made using the "pygame" library of python. Its a fun game to refresh our childhood where you can use bullets to kill randomly spawning aliens! 

- [Galaxy](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Games/Galaxy/): Galaxy is a 3D , cross platform game that is made using "kivy" library of python. Drive your spaceship through the infinite path!
