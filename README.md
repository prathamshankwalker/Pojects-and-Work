# Projects-and-Work
All the personal projects I have done so far are in this Repository

## Machine Learning using TensorFlow
- [InsuranceCP](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/regression_Insurance_prediction.ipynb)</b>: Regression model Using TensorFlow to predict the cost of insurance for individuals. 
- [FashionMnist](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/classification_fashion_mnist.ipynb) : Multi class Classification on the fashion mnist dataset In TensorFlow having 10 classes of fashion accessories.
- [Pizza/Steak](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/CNN_Pizza_Steak.ipynb) : To classify Images of Pizza and Steak using Covolutional Neural Networks.
- [Food101](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/CNN_Transfer_learning_food101_project.ipynb) : To classify 101 classes of Food images and beat the deep food paper using Transfer Learning. Used the EfficientnetB0 pretrained model for feature extraction and fine tuning.
- [DTweets](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/DTweets_NLP.ipynb) : To classify tweets indicating a disaster or not indicating a disaster (binary classification) using Natural Language processing.</li><br>
-  [SkimLit](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/SkimLit_NLP.ipynb) : To classify the abstract of a research paper into Objective, Methods, results, etc using natural language processing -Replication of the Pubmed research paper using tensorflow.
- [BitPredict](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/BitPredict_Timeseries_and_Forecasting.ipynb): Predicting the future price of Bitcoin using Timeseries and Forecasting Techniques.
    
## Web Dev
Basic Projects using html, css, JavaScript, php, Mysql

- [CRUD iNotes](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Web%20Dev/CRUD) : Basic Website which allows one to store notes into the database. Functionalities include: insert, delete, edit a note from the Mysql Database.
- [Credit](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Web%20Dev/credit) : This is a Creditors website for a business. It basically keeps the details of all the creditors(those who buy and pay the money later).
 One can add a new creditor, delete an existing and get the sum of amount he is left to pay. All the details of the creditors are stored in the database .<br>
 
 ## Games
  Initially to start with python, I tried to make some games out of curiousity

- [Space Invadors Retro](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Games/Space%20Invadors) : This is a 2D game made using the "pygame" library of python. Its a fun game to refresh our childhood where you can use bullets to kill randomly spawning aliens! 

- [Galaxy](https://github.com/prathamshankwalker/Projects-and-Work/tree/main/Games/Galaxy/): Galaxy is a 3D , cross platform game that is made using "kivy" library of python. Drive your spaceship through the infinite path!
