# Pojects-and-Work
<p>All the projects I have done so far are in this Repository</p><br>
<h2>Web Dev</h2>

<p>Basic Projects using html, css, JavaScript, php, Mysql </p>
 <li> CRUD iNotes : Basic Website which allows one to store notes into the database. Functionalities include: insert, delete, edit a note from the database(Mysql).</li>
 <li>  credit : This is a Creditors website for a business. It basically keeps the details of all the creditors(those who buy and pay the money later).
 One can add a new creditor, delete an existing and get the sum of amount he is left to pay. All the details of the creditors are stored in the database .<br>
 
 <h2>Games</h2>
 <p> Initially to start with python, I tried to make some games out of curiousity. </p>
 <li> Space Invadors Retro : This is a 2D game made using the "pygame" library of python. Its a fun game to refresh our childhood where you can use bullets to kill randomly spawning aliens! </li>
 <li> Galaxy : This is a 3D , cross platform game that is made using "kivy" library of python. Drive the spaceship through the infinite randomly generated path! </li>
